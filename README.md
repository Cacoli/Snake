This Java project implements a classic Snake game. The player controls a snake that grows by eating food, avoiding collisions with itself and the game boundaries.

About:-
    Basic snake movement (left, right, up, down)
    Food generation and consumption
    Game over condition (snake hitting itself or boundaries)
    Score tracking
    Simple graphics (using Java's built-in graphics library)
    
For controls:-
    Use arrow keys to control the snake's direction.

Future Improvements:-
    Add levels or difficulty settings
    Implement different game modes (e.g., time-based, survival)
    Improve graphics and sound effects
    Add multiplayer functionality
